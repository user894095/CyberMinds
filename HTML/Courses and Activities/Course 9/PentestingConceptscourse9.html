        <p>
          In the Reconnaissance and Enumeration reading, we talked about some of
          the processes that happen at the
          <span class="blue-word">beginning</span> of the hacking process. The
          following concepts that will be talked about in this article will
          <span class="blue-word">refer</span> to the concepts that are applied
          during an attack.
        </p>

        <h3 class="blue-word">Privilege Escalation:</h3>

        <p>
          Also talked about in
          <span class="blue-word">Course 6,</span> privilege escalation refers
          to, literally, elevating the privileges that you have. In hacking,
          privilege escalation is used to dig further and further into systems.
          Once privileges are <span class="blue-word">escalated</span>, they can
          be used to access new parts of the system.
        </p>

        <h3 class="blue-word">Lateral Movement:</h3>

        <p>
          Lateral movement is the process of
          <span class="blue-word">expanding</span> access to a system to more
          parts of the system. An example of this could be using the credentials
          of a normal employee to gain access to one part of the
          <span class="blue-word">system</span>. From there, other attacks and
          privilege escalation could be used to find more credentials to admin
          accounts, which unlocks much more of the system.
        </p>

        <h3 class="blue-word">Pivoting:</h3>

        <p>
          Pivoting, also known as island hopping, is the process of “hopping”
          through many different targets to ultimately attack the main target.
          For instance, an <span class="blue-word">attacker</span> may go
          through the systems of third-party suppliers of the target in order to
          gain <span class="blue-word">information</span> about them.
        </p>

        <h3 class="blue-word">Persistence:</h3>

        <p>
          Persistence does not refer to attacking something over and over again,
          but it refers to maintaining a
          <span class="blue-word">continuous</span> connection to the system.
          Backdoors (Course 7) are examples of attacks that provide continuous,
          persistent connections to a target. An Advanced Persistent Threat
          <span class="blue-word">(APT)</span> is also a good example of using
          persistence in an attack, since an
          <span class="blue-word">APT</span> is a type of threat actor that can
          remain in a system undetected for long periods of time.
