        <h3 class="blue-word">Types of Hackers:</h3>
        <p>
          Not all of these types of hackers are
          <span class="blue-word">pentesters</span>
          , but it is good to know the different types and which ones are
          <span class="blue-word">penetration testers</span>
          versus
          <span class="blue-word">malicious threat actors</span>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="green-word">Black Hat:</span>
          any hacker with malicious intent, such as
          <span class="blue-word">cybercriminals.</span>
          <br />

          <span class="green-word">White Hat:</span>
          any hacker with non-malicious intent.
          <span class="blue-word"> Pentesters</span>
          fall under this category.<br />

          <span class="green-word">Gray Hat:</span>
          hackers that are neither black nor white hat hackers. They could be
          freelance hackers that take any type of work, or employed hackers that
          have their own motives during their free time.<br />

          <span class="green-word">Vigilante:</span>
          Also known as
          <span class="blue-word">red hat hackers,</span>
          vigilantes are freelance hackers that hack based on their own moral
          agenda. They usually hack black hat hackers and attempt to stop their
          operations.<br />

          <span class="green-word">Blue Hat:</span>
          hackers employed by an organization , usually refers to
          <span class="blue-word">company pentesters.</span>
          <br />

          <span class="green-word">Green Hat:</span>
          inexperienced hackers, such as
          <span class="blue-word">script kiddies</span>
          (Course 3).<br />

          <span class="green-word">Hacktivists:</span>
          hackers looking to spread their political agenda. Previous cases of
          hacktivists have been known to disturb new stations and be nuisances
          .<br />

          <span class="green-word">State-Employed:</span>
          also known as
          <span class="blue-word">state-sponsored</span>
          (Course 3), hackers working for governments.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          There are definitely more types of hackers than just these, but as you
          can imagine, the <span class="blue-word">variety</span> of
          <span class="blue-word">motives</span> that hackers have makes the
          difference between stereotypical hacking and
          <span class="blue-word">pentesting</span> clearer.
        </p>

        <h3 class="blue-word">Different “Boxes” in Pentesting:</h3>
        <p>
          There are a variety of ways in which
          <span class="blue-word">pentesting</span> is carried out. These are
          referred to as black, white, and grey box hacking:
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="green-word">Black Box:</span>
          the pentester begins hacking with
          <span class="blue-word">no prior information</span>
          given to them. This is the most realistic scenario when compared to
          the real world, so it can be more effective.<br />

          <span class="green-word">White Box:</span>
          the pentester begins hacking with
          <span class="blue-word">all information</span>
          about the system given to them, this can include network structures
          and credentials .<br />

          <span class="green-word">Gray Box: </span>
          the pentester begins with
          <span class="blue-word">some information</span>
          about the system given to them, not all or none.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Different “boxes” of hacking can be used to simulate different
          scenarios or just to provide the pentester with enough information
          that they need to be able to form an accurate report of the
          <span class="blue-word">company’s security.</span>
          Black box hacking is more realistic and more useful in finding
          <span class="blue-word">unknown vulnerabilities,</span> while white
          box hacking makes pentests faster and allows companies to simulate
          attacks and their responses.
