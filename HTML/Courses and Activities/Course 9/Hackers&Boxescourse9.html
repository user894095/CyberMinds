        <h3>Types of Hackers</h3>
        <p>
          Not all of these types of hackers are
          <span class="blue-word">pentesters</span>
          , but it is good to know the different types and which ones are
          <span class="blue-word">penetration testers</span>
          versus
          <span class="blue-word">malicious threat actors</span>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="blue-word">Black Hat:</span>
          any hacker with
          <span class="blue-word">malicious</span>
          intent, such as
          <span class="blue-word">cybercriminals</span>
          .<br />

          <span class="blue-word">White Hat:</span>
          any hacker with
          <span class="blue-word">non-malicious</span>
          intent.
          <span class="blue-word"> Pentesters</span>
          fall under this category.<br />

          <span class="blue-word">Gray Hat:</span>
          hackers that are neither black nor white hat hackers. They could be
          <span class="blue-word">freelance</span>
          hackers that take any type of work, or employed hackers that have
          their
          <span class="blue-word">own motives</span>
          during their free time.<br />

          <span class="blue-word">Vigilante:</span>
          Also known as
          <span class="blue-word">red hat hackers</span>
          , vigilantes are
          <span class="blue-word">freelance hackers</span>
          that hack based on their own moral agenda. They usually hack black hat
          hackers and attempt to stop their operations.<br />

          <span class="blue-word">Blue Hat:</span>
          hackers employed by an
          <span class="blue-word">organization</span>
          , usually refers to
          <span class="blue-word">company pentesters</span>
          .<br />

          <span class="blue-word">Green Hat:</span>
          <span class="blue-word">inexperienced</span>
          hackers, such as
          <span class="blue-word">script kiddies</span>
          (Course 3).<br />

          <span class="blue-word">Hacktivists:</span>
          hackers looking to spread their
          <span class="blue-word">political agenda</span>
          . Previous cases of hacktivists have been known to disturb new
          stations and be
          <span class="blue-word">nuisances</span>
          .<br />

          <span class="blue-word">State-Employed:</span>
          also known as
          <span class="blue-word">state-sponsored</span>
          (Course 3), hackers working for governments.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          There are definitely more types of hackers than just these, but as you
          can imagine, the variety of motives that hackers have makes the
          difference between stereotypical hacking and pentesting clearer.
        </p>

        <h3>Different “Boxes” in Pentesting:</h3>
        <p>
          There are a variety of ways in which pentesting is carried out. These
          are referred to as black, white, and grey box hacking:
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="blue-word">Black Box:</span>
          the pentester begins hacking with
          <span class="blue-word">no prior information</span>
          given to them. This is the
          <span class="blue-word">most realistic</span>
          scenario when compared to the real world, so it can be more
          effective.<br />

          <span class="blue-word">White Box:</span>
          the pentester begins hacking with
          <span class="blue-word">all information</span>
          about the system given to them, this can include
          <span class="blue-word">network structures</span>
          and
          <span class="blue-word">credentials</span>
          .<br />

          <span class="blue-word">Gray Box: </span>
          the pentester begins with
          <span class="blue-word">some information</span>
          about the system given to them, not all or none.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Different “boxes” of hacking can be used to simulate different
          scenarios or just to provide the pentester with enough information
          that they need to be able to form an accurate report of the
          <span class="blue-word">company’s security</span>
          . Black box hacking is more realistic and more useful in finding
          <span class="blue-word">unknown vulnerabilities</span>
          , while white box hacking makes pentests faster and allows companies
          to
          <span class="blue-word">simulate attacks</span>
          and their responses.
