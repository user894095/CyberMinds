          If you are interested in learning or practicing hacking, there are a
          variety of websites that are free to use! We recommend the following:
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="green-word"
            >*Note:</span> please use these resources in your pentesting journey, never
            attempt to hack a real website or application :)
        </p>

        <h3 class="blue-word">Highly Recommended Sites:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">TryHackMe:</span> very beginner friendly and
            also had additional cybersecurity information!
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">picoCTF:</span> beginner friendly and has
            CTF challenges based on a variety of security skills
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">HackTheBox: </span>a little less beginner
            friendly, but once you begin to understand hacking, it is the go-to
            practice tool due to the multitude of instances you can practice on
            and the vast HTB community
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <span class="green-word">*CTF:</span> CTF stands for capture the flag.
          This refers to challenges in which players must use their
          cybersecurity skills to find and submit a flag, which is usually just
          a string of characters.
        </p>

        <h3 class="blue-word">Other Recommended Resources:</h3>
        <ul>

            skills, has many levels of CTF
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">PentesterLab: </span>also has a variety of
            instances to pentest, similar to HackTheBox
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA): </span>must
            be run on a virtual machine (such as <span class="blue-word">VirtualBox</span> (Course 6)), has

            to change the difficulty
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">TheBadStore: </span>also must be run on a
            virtual machine, TheBadStore is a <span class="blue-word">fake</span>, hackable website where you
            can safely practice.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="blue-word">Additional Reading: Bug Bounty Hunting (Optional):</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="blue-word">Bug bounty hunting (BBH)</span> can be casual, but usually happens in
          competitions where pentesters attempt to find bugs in a system.
          Sometimes, companies hold BBH events where those who find
          vulnerabilities in their system can win prizes or money. If you are
          ever comfortable with penetration, try to see if there are any of
          these events in your area!
