        <h2>Public vs. Private Key Cryptography</h2>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Basic Terms of Cryptography:</span></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Plaintext:</span> original text,
            unencrypted
          </li>
          <li><span class="green-word">Ciphertext:</span> encrypted text</li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Key:</span> a piece of information used to
            encode and decode messages
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Private Key Cryptography:</span></h3>
        <p>
          Private key algorithms, also known as symmetric algorithms, use the
          same key for encryption and decryption. Although it is faster and
          takes up less storage to save only one key, it is less secure. This
          key is also known as a
          <span class="blue-word">private key</span> and it known between the
          parties of communication. If an attacker were to get a hold of the
          key, entire <span class="blue-word">systems</span> using a symmetric
          algorithm could be at risk.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Symmetric Encryption Algorithms:</span></h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="green-word">CC</span> - Caesar Cipher</li>
          <li><span class="green-word">VC</span> - Vigenere Cipher</li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">AES</span> - Advanced Encryption Standard
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">DES</span> - Data Encryption Standard
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">The Caesar Cipher (Example):</span></h3>
        <p>
          The Caesar Cipher got its name from being created around the time of
          Caesar. It is one of the earliest forms of
          <span class="blue-word">encryption</span> and was used by Caesar to
          send messages to his military. It is also quite basic, here is how it
          works:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="green-word">Plaintext:</span> hello world</li>
          <li><span class="green-word">Key:</span> 5</li>
          <li><span class="green-word">Ciphertext:</span> mjqqt btwqi</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Just from this information, you might be able to see how this cipher
          works. The key, which is an <span class="blue-word">integer</span>,
          represents how many letters in the alphabet the original message
          should be shifted by.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Public Key Cryptography:</span></h3>

        <p>
          Public key algorithms are also called asymmetric algorithms, they use
          <span class="blue-word">one key</span> for encryption and a different
          key for decryption. Each party in an asymmetric algorithm has a public
          key and a private key. Public key algorithms take up more space and
          are slower, but they are definitely more secure. They are developed
          using some <span class="blue-word">complex</span> math… we will go
          over an example of how one of the algorithms work, but for a start,
          here is a general example.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">General Example:</span></h3>

        <ol type="1">
          <li>Alice wants to send Bob a message with asymmetric encryption.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Alice uses <span class="green-word">Bob’s public key</span> to
            encrypt her message as she sends it to Bob
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Bob receives the encrypted message and uses
            <span class="green-word">Bob’s private key</span> to decrypt it.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Bob wants to send a message back, he encrypts it with
            <span class="green-word">Alice’s public key</span>.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Alice receives the message and uses
            <span class="green-word">Alice’s private key</span> to decrypt it.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          To remember this, you can use the analogy of a
          <span class="blue-word">mailbox</span>. Messages are sent and
          encrypted using the recipient’s public key, similar to how you can put
          mail in a recipient’s mailbox, which is available to everyone.
          Messages are <span class="blue-word">decrypted</span> using the
          recipient’s own private key, similar to how the recipient is the only
          one that has the key to their own mailbox. When the mail is in the
          mailbox, it is equivalent to a message being in the state of
          <span class="blue-word">encryption</span>.

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Symmetric Encryption Algorithms:</span></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)</li>
          <li>Diffie-Hellman</li>
          <li>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="blue-word">RSA Algorithm (Example):</span></p>

        <p>
          If you have been wondering how the use of more than one key can result
          in the same message, this <span class="blue-word">RSA</span> may help
          you understand more. This example will use small numbers for
          simplicity. But in the real world,
          <span class="blue-word">RSA</span> relies on incredibly large prime
          numbers and the fact that they are difficult to compute, even for
          computers.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">RSA Encoding Process:</span></h3>

        <dl>
          <dt>
            1)Choose two large prime numbers, p
            and q:
          </dt>
          <dd>We are going to use two small ones, 5 and 7.</dd>
          <br />
          <dt>
            2)The public key consists of two
            parts: integer n and integer e. The n value equals p times q.
          </dt>
          <dd>n = p*q</dd>
          <dd>n = 5*7 = 35</dd>
          <br />
          <dt>
            3) The e value must also be an
            integer, but not a factor of phi of n (Φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)).
          </dt>
          <dd>Φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)</dd>
          <dd>Φ(n) = (5-1)(7-1) = (4)(6) = 24</dd>
          <dd>e = 5</dd>
          <br />
          <dt>
            4)Now we must create our private
            key, d. The d value uses the previously generated values, (d*e)%Φ
            must be equal to 1.
          </dt>
          <dd>(d*e)%Φ = 1</dd>
          <dd>(5*5)%24 = 1</dd>
          <dd>d = 5</dd>
          <br />
          <dt>
            5) We will now use our generated
            values to encrypt our plaintext (a). Ciphertext (c) = (a^e)%n
          </dt>
          <dd>c = (a^e)%n</dd>
          <dd>H: c = (8^5)%35 = 8</dd>
          <dd>I: c = (9^5)%35 = 4</dd>
          <br />
          <dd>
            Note: Try to use a programming or scientific calculator if you are
            unable to find modulo on a standard calculator.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            Note 2: the ciphertext for the letter H ended up the same as the
            plaintext for this example. This is just a coincidence and it does
            not always happen.
          </dd>
          <br />
          <dd>The cipher text for the word “HI” using our keys is 8 4</dd>
          <br />
          <dt>
            6) We will decrypt the message. The
            equation for this is: (a) = (c^d)%n
          </dt>
          <dd>a = (c^e)%n</dd>
          <dd>H: a = (8^5)%35 = 8</dd>
          <dd>I: a = (4^5)%35 = 9</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          That was definitely a lot, but we successfully used a public key to
          encrypt and a private key to decrypt, and we got the same message!
          This example used a lot of smaller numbers for the sake of simplicity,
          so there were a lot of repeating numbers. The
          <span class="blue-word">point</span> is, the
          <span class="blue-word">math</span> checks out so that even when you
          use a different key to decrypt, you will end up with the same
          plaintext. Feel free to try this with larger numbers, and you will get
          more realistic examples of how this works. There are also plenty of
          resources online that can explain the
          <span class="blue-word">algorithm</span>, walkthroughs and calculators
          for <span class="blue-word">RSA</span>, and other information on this
          and other ciphers! Additionally, understanding the
          <span class="blue-word">process</span> and the underlying
          <span class="blue-word">principles</span> is crucial for mastering
          RSA.
