        <p>
          Hashing is <span class="blue-word">one-way encryption.</span> Once you
          have encrypted your plaintext, it cannot be decrypted. Obviously,
          unlike encryption, hashing would be terrible to use for communication
          since recipients of messages would just be reading a bunch of
          ciphertext! The real use for hashing is for verifying data integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
          An easy and applicable example of hashing relates to
          <span class="blue-word">passwords.</span> When passwords are stored,
          they <span class="blue-word">should always be hashed.</span> When you
          enter your password into a login page, your input will be hashed and
          compared to the hash in the database with all the saved passwords, the
          comparison will verify if you typed in the correct password. By
          hashing such an important credential, attackers cannot access your
          password if they manage to get a hold of the database (there are ways
          they get around this, we will talk about this in the Cryptographic
          Attacks article). This is a much safer option than just leaving all
          stored passwords in plaintext.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you recall back in Course 1, the “I” in the CIA triad stood for
          integrity. Integrity in security refers to the accuracy of data and
          reliance on the fact that it cannot be modified. Hashing is used for
          this. Hashes of data are known as
          <span class="blue-word">checksums.</span> It is also important to note
          that a checksum is completely unique to the data it represents. As
          data is transmitted between different parts of a network, it is
          important to make sure that the data stays unmodified by accident or
          by attackers. At different stages during its transit, the checksum of
          the original data can be compared to the checksum of the data after
          transit (or at any other stage) in order to make sure that the data is
          the same. If the checksums are different, it means the data has been
          modified.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blue-word">Parts of a Reliable Hashing Algorithm:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A hashing algorithm should always result in a
            <span class="green-word">hash</span> of the same
            <span class="green-word">length</span> as to not let the length of
            the checksum correlate to the data
          </li>
          <li>
            No two <span class="green-word">hashes</span> (of different pieces
            of data) should be the same. A hash should always be
            <span class="green-word">unique</span>. Should anything in the data
            change, the hash should come out different.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <span class="green-word">hash</span> should not be predictable in
            any way that can help an attacker decipher the algorithm.
          </li>
          <li>
            If any one of these principles is not followed by the algorithm, it
            makes it <span class="green-word">unreliable!</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="blue-word">Collisions:</h2>
        <p>
          If two hash outputs are the same for different inputs, this is known
          as a collision. A collision can also refer to different people using
          the same credential so that there are multiple instances of a hash
          value in a database.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blue-word">Common Hashing Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
          The Secure Hashing Algorithms (SHA) are the standard hash to use
          today. SHA was developed by the National Institute of Standards and
          Technology and was made a federal standard. SHA-256 is an incredibly
          common algorithm, 256 representing the length of the hash in bits.
          However, SHA-512 has been released as well, and due to its increased
          length, it is a little more complex and also highly used.
