    <section>
      <div class="right-side_rectangle">
        <p>
          <span class="green-word">*Note:</span> please do not try any of these
          attacks on a real system, only practice these on designated software
        </p>

        <p>
          A <span class="blue-word">cryptographic attack</span> is a cyberattack
          that allows the attacker to bypass cryptographic defenses. The most
          common example of a cryptographic attack would be attempting to log
          into an account with different credentials because this is meant to
          get around the fact that credentials are hashed when stored and cannot
          be accessed in their databases. In this article, we will explore how
          different cryptographic attacks relate to this example.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="green-word">*Note:</span> This process of attempting to
          crack or exploit cryptographic systems is called cryptanalysis.
          However, cryptanalysis refers more to cracking a cryptographic
          algorithm rather than bypassing it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="blue-word">Brute Forcing:</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="blue-word">Brute forcing</span>, like the name implies,
          is the process of trying every combination of credentials in order to
          gain access to a system, specifically finding a password to a certain
          username. Obviously, there are billions of combinations for an
          attacker to try. Computer programs are used to speed this process up,
          but we could all be dead before a successful combination is found.
          That is why there are some strategies and variations of brute forcing
          that are used to find a match:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word">Ordinary Brute Forcing:</span> trying every
            combination ever, not a very efficient use of time
          </li>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="green-word">Likelihood of Success:</span> Guaranteed
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="green-word">Time: </span>Could be 2 septillion years…
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word">Rainbow Table Attack:</span> a rainbow table
            attack uses a wordlist with each credential’s hash. It is likely to
            have less credentials to go through than a dictionary since the
            hashes take up more space.
          </li>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="green-word">Likelihood of Success:</span> Higher the
              larger the dictionary is, attackers are likely to use something
              that makes is possible for them to succeed
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="green-word">Time:</span> Longer the larger the
              dictionary is, attackers will use something that a computer can go
              through in a short to medium amount of time
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word">Reverse Brute Forcing:</span> taking a
            commonly used password and trying many usernames with it. Reverse
            brute forcing (and other attacks not mentioned here) can be paired
            with wordlists or rainbow tables to expedite the brute forcing
            process.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"
              >Using Common Credentials (additional concept):</span
            >
            Attackers can minimize the amount of time to brute force by limiting
            their wordlists to only credentials that are common.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="blue-word">Collision-Exploiting Attacks:</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="blue-word">Collision-exploiting attacks</span> take
          advantage of repeating <span class="blue-word">hashes</span>, or
          collisions. Sometimes, these can exploit errors in a poorly
          constructed hashing algorithm that resulted in collisions. They can
          also exploit repeat hashes in databases. Examples of
          collision-exploiting attacks are classic collision attacks and
          birthday attacks. A
          <span class="blue-word">cryptographic defense</span> to collision
          attacks is <span class="blue-word">salting</span>. Salting is when a
          random string of characters, known as a salt, is appended to the end
          of a credential before it is hashed. So, if two people use the same
          password, the added salt changes the hashes so they are not the same
          in storage.
