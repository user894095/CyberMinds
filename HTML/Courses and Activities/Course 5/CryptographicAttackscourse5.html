        <h2>Cryptographic Attacks</h2>
        <p>
          *Note: please do not try any of these attacks on a real system,
            only practice these on designated software :)
        </p>

        <p>
          A <span class="blue-word">cryptographic attack</span> is a cyberattack that allows the attacker to
          bypass cryptographic defenses.
          The most common example of a cryptographic attack would be attempting
          to log into an account with different credentials because this is
          meant to get around the fact that credentials are hashed when stored
          and cannot be accessed in their databases. In this article, we will
          explore how different cryptographic attacks relate to this example.
        </p>

        <p>
          
            *Note: This process of attempting to crack or exploit cryptographic
            systems is called cryptanalysis. However, cryptanalysis refers more
            to cracking a cryptographic algorithm rather than bypassing it.
          
        </p>

        <h3>Brute Forcing:</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="blue-word"
            >Brute forcing</span>, like the name implies, is the process of trying
            every combination of credentials in order to gain access to a
            system,
          specifically finding a password to a certain username. Obviously,
          there are billions of combinations for an attacker to try. Computer
          programs are used to speed this process up, but we could all be dead
          before a successful combination is found. That is why there are some
          strategies and variations of brute forcing that are used to find a
          match:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word">Ordinary Brute Forcing:</span> trying
            every combination ever, not a very efficient use of time
          </li>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="green-word">Likelihood of Success:</span> Guaranteed
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="green-word">Time: </span>Could be 2 septillion years…
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word">Rainbow Table Attack:</span> a rainbow
            table attack uses a wordlist with each credential’s hash. It is
            likely to have less credentials to go through than a dictionary
            since the hashes take up more space.
          </li>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="green-word">Likelihood of Success:</span> Higher the
              larger the dictionary is, attackers are likely to use something
              that makes is possible for them to succeed
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="green-word">Time:</span> Longer the larger the
              dictionary is, attackers will use something that a computer can go
              through in a short to medium amount of time
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word">Reverse Brute Forcing:</span> taking a
            commonly used password and trying many usernames with it. Reverse
            brute forcing (and other attacks not mentioned here) can be paired
            with wordlists or rainbow tables to expedite the brute forcing
            process.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"
              >Using Common Credentials (additional concept):</span
            >
            Attackers can minimize the amount of time to brute force by limiting
            their wordlists to only credentials that are common.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Collision-Exploiting Attacks:</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="blue-word"
            >Collision-exploiting attacks</span> take advantage of repeating <span class="blue-word">hashes</span>, or
            collisions. Sometimes, these can exploit errors in a poorly constructed hashing
          algorithm that resulted in collisions. They can also exploit repeat
          hashes in databases. Examples of collision-exploiting attacks are
          classic collision attacks and birthday attacks.
          A <span class="blue-word">cryptographic defense</span> to collision attacks is <span class="blue-word">salting</span>. Salting is
            when a random string of characters, known as a salt, is appended to
            the end of a credential before it is hashed.
          
          So, if two people use the same password, the added salt changes the
          hashes so they are not the same in storage.
