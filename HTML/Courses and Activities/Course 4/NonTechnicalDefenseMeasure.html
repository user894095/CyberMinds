          Defense does not only come in the form of firewalls and protective
          software, any measure, whether technical or not, should be taken to
          keep the digital world <span class="blue-word">safe</span>.
          Additionally, it is said that humans are the<span class="blue-word">
            weakest link</span
          >
          in security, this is something that software cannot fix. Measures are
          taken to ensure that information does not
          <span class="blue-word">fall</span> into the wrong hands or misused.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Defense in Depth:</span></h3>
        <p>
          Defense in depth refers to using more than one layer of defense. > An
          example of this is two-factor authentication
          <span class="blue-word">(TFA or 2FA)</span>. In addition to providing
          a username and password, TFA may ask you security questions to prove
          you are who you say you are. Since this uses more than one layer of
          security, it reflects the defense in depth concept. Defense in
          <span class="blue-word">Depth</span> can also refer to using more
          technical measures, like multiple firewalls (Course 10), intrusion
          detection systems (later in this course), etc.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Avoiding Security by Obscurity:</span></h3>
        <p>
          Security by obscurity refers to using secrecy to keep things secure.
          For instance, if you use a certain encryption algorithm (Course 5) to
          encrypt data sent between <span class="blue-word">clients</span> and a
          server on your application, keeping this algorithm secret should not
          be your only defense. A defense method should be so
          <span class="blue-word">secure</span> that even if someone finds out
          what it is, they would not be able to exploit it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going back to the previous example, a
          <span class="blue-word">proxy</span> server (Course 10) can be added
          to check that messages are unaltered before sending them to the
          recipient to avoid interception attacks. This makes it so that even if
          an attacker knew the encryption algorithm and
          <span class="blue-word">altered</span> messages, a proxy server would
          still catch the alterations. Although you should not rely on security
          by obscurity, that does not mean you should
          <span class="blue-word">reveal</span> all of your security defenses
          anyways!
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Separation of Concerns:</span></h3>
        <p>
          Separation of concerns in cybersecurity means giving different people
          working on a system <span class="blue-word">different</span> tasks. No
          person should be working on any additional tasks outside their role,
          this helps with organization as well as preventing users from
          <span class="blue-word">tampering</span> with other parts of a system
          that could result in a security incident, whether intentional or
          unintentional.
        </p>
        <h3><span class="blue-word">Least Privilege:</span></h3>

        <p>
          The concept of <span class="blue-word">least</span> privilege refers
          to giving users the bare minimum permissions they need to complete
          their tasks. There is no reason for anyone to be running commands or
          accessing things that are unrelated to their job. Minimizing the
          permissions people have <span class="blue-word">lessen</span> the
          amount of mistakes that can be made or the chances of an insider
          attack.
        </p>
