          <span class="blue-word">Cyber-Threats to Individuals:</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Individuals are most likely to be targeted by cybercriminals in search
          of money. This is especially true for the
          <span class="blue-word"> elderly population</span>, who are not as
          familiar with technology as
          <span class="blue-word"> younger people</span>. Unlike companies,
          there are not many security policies that individuals have to adhere
          to. Obviously, there are
          <span class="blue-word"> laws</span> prohibiting unauthorized hacking
          and offensive actions. However, when it comes to policies for ordinary
          internet users to keep themselves
          <span class="blue-word"> safe</span> , it is really a matter of
          preference as to how they want to do it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without taking any security measures, individuals make themselves
          <span class="blue-word"> vulnerable</span> to revealing their data
          which can lead to financial loss or hindrances in
          <span class="blue-word"> daily life.</span>
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word">Actions Individuals Should Take...</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Regardless of your <span class="blue-word"> role</span> on the
          internet, there are some security recommendations that everyone should
          try to follow! From basic to more advanced, here are some things that
          you can implement to protect yourself from
          <span class="blue-word"> cyberattacks.</span>

            General Recomendations (Applicable to Everyone):</span

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word"> Passwords:</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is vital that you use
          <span class="blue-word"> strong password</span> . Here are the
          qualities of a
          <span class="blue-word"> strong password:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">No</span> full
            <span class="green-word">words</span> or phrases
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">No</span> relation
            <span class="green-word">to</span> you
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Include</span> a variety of different
            <span class="green-word">characters</span> (uppercase, lowercase,
            special, numbers)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">At</span> least
            <span class="green-word">8 characters</span> in length
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <span class="blue-word"> Websites</span> and
          <span class="blue-word"> Applications</span> usually force users to
          adhere to these password guidelines for the purpose of
          <span class="blue-word"> security.</span> However, when these
          guidelines are not <span class="blue-word"> enforced</span> , it is
          the userâ€™s responsibility to set a password that is
          <span class="blue-word"> secure.</span> Here are some examples of
          passwords:
        </p>
        <h3>
          <span class="green-word">Good Passwords:</span>
        </h3>
        <ul class="list-without-bullet-points">
          <li><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> X9Gj*j3^8</li>
          <li><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> @kl9$lKd3#</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <span class="green-word">Bad Passwords:</span>
        </h3>
        <ul class="list-without-bullet-points">
          <li><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> iLoveCats123</li>
          <li><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> 12345678</li>
          <li><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Password</li>
          <li><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> tHeGu1tar</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Lastly, you should not write down your passwords on paper or
          digitally. You should always use a password manager because they are
          optimized for security.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word"> Other General Recomendations:</span>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Use a VPN:</span> a Virtual Private Network
            will establish secure connections between devices and encrypt data
            in transit to prevent someone from intercepting your communications
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Avoid Unsecure Websites:</span> generally
            avoid HTTP sites, they are not as secure as HTTPS
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Don't</span> click on suspicious links or
            files
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Don't</span> reveal personal information to
            untrusted people
          </li>
        </ul>
