        <h2>The Importance of Cybersecurity for Companies</h2>
        <p>
          While companies have more robust
          <span class="blue-word">security</span> systems, they can still be
          attacked. Companies can be targeted by competitors looking to gain an
          advantage or by <span class="blue-word">cybercriminals</span> seeking
          the company’s money. It is vital that companies protect themselves
          from cyberthreats because attacks against them can affect the people
          they serve. Without <span class="blue-word">proper</span> security,
          people will not trust companies to handle their data. Both parties can
          suffer a financial loss or theft of personal data with companies being
          especially vulnerable to
          <span class="blue-word">reputational damage</span>.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Actions that Companies Take:</span></h3>

        <p>
          You will learn about more defensive measures in course 4, but here are
          some topics to get you started:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Training/Awareness:</span> training that
            companies provide their employees or even their clients on security
            prevents people from making blunders that can risk the companies
            welfare.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Intrusion Detection Tools:</span>
            Companies use tools to warn them of intrusions or suspicious
            activity on their systems
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Policies:</span> Both company policies and
            mandatory policies levied by the government improve the security of
            company systems
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Frameworks:</span></h3>
        <p>
          A framework in cybersecurity is a model that dictates how companies
          should respond to security incidents. There are a variety of
          frameworks that companies can choose to use, some of them being a
          company’s own framework. In the following example, we will look at the
          <span class="blue-word">NIST CSF.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="blue-word">NIST </span>is the National Institute of
          Standards and Technology, and they created the
          <span class="blue-word">NIST CSF</span> or the
          <span class="blue-word">NIST</span> Cybersecurity Framework . This is
          one of the most popular frameworks used by organizations. This is the
          NIST CSF:
        </p>
        <img class="nist-csf" src="../../../Images/nist-csf.png" />

        <h3><span class="blue-word"> Stages of the NIST CSF</span></h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word"> Identify:</span> Identifying assets and
            areas in a system where attacks can occur.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word"> Protect:</span> Taking necessary measures
            to protect assets and seal attack vectors in preparation for
            possible attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word"> Detect:</span> Once an attack occurs, the
            source of the attack and areas of the system that were affected must
            be detected.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word"> Respond:</span> Containing the attack and
            its effects to a certain area and eliminating the attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word"> Recover:</span> Restoring the system back
            to its original state, fixing vulnerabilities that led to the
            attack, and reflecting on what could have been done better.
          </li>
        </ol>
