        <span class="blue-word">Spoofing is impersonation</span>. This may sound like another attack you may have read
        about in course 3: social engineering, where impersonation is often used.
        <span class="blue-word">Spoofing is different in the sense that it is not a social attack, but a technical
          attack.</span>
        “Technical impersonation” can come in the form of
        <span class="blue-word">altering information</span>
        about your device or altering another
        entity's information.
        Let's look at more examples of this…
      </p>

      <h3>Email Spoofing</h3>
      <p>
        Email spoofing is creating a
        <span class="blue-word">false
          email address</span>
        to impersonate.
        Email spoofing is often used in phishing. If you recall the phishing exercises in course 3, many of those used
        email spoofing.
        Emails that used the names of real companies attempted to
        <span class="blue-word">mislead</span>
        others.
      </p>

      <p>
        *Note: it is recommended that you look at course 10 before the following attacks:
      </p>

      <h3>IP Spoofing</h3>
      <p>
        IP addresses are unique device identifiers on a network.
        IP spoofing is when an
        <span class="blue-word">attacker uses a false IP address to impersonate another device that is not their
          own</span>
        . Attackers do this by using tools to
        <span class="blue-word">alter the IP addresses in packet headers</span>
        .
        If this information is changed, any computing device that processes the IP address is likely to pass the
        altered packet along, making it a dangerous attack.
        IP spoofing is used mainly for <span class="blue-word">identity theft</span>, and can easily fool computer
        systems if they are not
        thoroughly checking the packet's <span class="blue-word">checksums</span> (Course 5).
      </p>

      <h3>DNS Spoofing</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="blue-word">DNS Spoofing: </span>
        The
        <span class="blue-word">domain name system (DNS)</span>
        is a system used to link website names to IP addresses.
        A DNS server is filled with databases linking names to addresses.
        DNS spoofing when an alteration is made to these databases, directing users to different websites than what
        they should be directed to.
        In many cases, the new website is malicious and
        <span class="blue-word">meant to steal users' information</span>
        . DNS spoofing is done through <span class="blue-word">DNS poisoning</span>, which is the process of altering
        a DNS cache or data to return incorrect responses.
        The effects of DNS spoofing also come in many other variations, such as
        <span class="blue-word">interception attacks</span>
        that redirect
        users (next article).
      </p>

      <p>
        Almost any piece of digital information pertaining to identity can be spoofed, these were just the common
        ones.
        Other values like phone numbers, locations, etc. can be spoofed as well.
