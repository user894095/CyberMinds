          Spoofing is
          <span class="blue-word">impersonation</span>. This may sound like
          another attack you may have read about in course 3: social
          engineering, where impersonation is often used. Spoofing is different
          in the sense that it is not a social attack, but a
          <span class="blue-word">technical attack.</span>
          “Technical impersonation” can come in the form of
          <span class="blue-word">altering information</span>
          about your device or altering another entity's information. Let's look
          at more examples of this…

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Email Spoofing</span></h3>
        <p>
          Email spoofing is creating a
          <span class="blue-word">false email address</span>
          to impersonate. Email spoofing is often used in phishing. If you
          recall the phishing exercises in course 3, many of those used email
          spoofing. Emails that used the names of real companies attempted to
          <span class="blue-word">mislead</span>
          others.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="green-word">*Note:</span> it is recommended that you look
          at course 10 before the following attacks:
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">IP Spoofing</span></h3>
        <p>
          IP addresses are unique device identifiers on a network. IP spoofing
          is when an attacker uses a
          <span class="blue-word">false IP address</span>
          to impersonate another device that is not their own. Attackers do this
          by using tools to alter the IP addresses in
          <span class="blue-word">packet headers</span>
          . If this information is changed, any computing device that processes
          the IP address is likely to pass the altered packet along, making it a
          dangerous attack. IP spoofing is used mainly for
          <span class="blue-word">identity theft</span>, and can easily fool
          computer systems if they are not thoroughly checking the packet's
          <span class="blue-word">checksums</span> (Course 5).
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">DNS Spoofing</span></h3>
        <p>
          The
          <span class="blue-word">domain name system (DNS)</span>
          is a system used to link website names to IP addresses. A DNS server
          is filled with databases linking names to addresses. DNS spoofing when
          an alteration is made to these databases, directing users to different
          websites than what they should be directed to. In many cases, the new
          website is malicious and meant to
          <span class="blue-word">steal users' information</span>
          . DNS spoofing is done through
          <span class="blue-word">DNS poisoning</span>, which is the process of
          altering a DNS cache or data to return incorrect responses. The
          effects of DNS spoofing also come in many other variations, such as
          <span class="blue-word">interception attacks</span>
          that redirect users (next article).
        </p>

        <p>
          Almost any piece of digital information pertaining to identity can be
          spoofed, these were just the common ones. Other values like phone
          numbers, locations, etc. can be spoofed as well.
