          An <span class="blue-word">intercepting attack</span> is an attack
          based on
          <span class="blue-word">intercepting data</span>
          in transit. Interception can be used to aid in many different attacks,
          such as <span class="blue-word">spoofing</span>. Packets can be
          intercepted before being altered, leading to spoofing.
          <span class="blue-word">Interception</span> is definitely its own
          attack as well, let's look at some types of interception attacks:
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="green-word">*Note:</span> it is recommended that you look
          at course 10 before the following attacks:
        </p>

        <img
          src="../../../Images/interceptionAttacks.jpg"
          style="
            width: 20em;
            height: auto;
            border-width: 1em;
            border-style: solid; /* Specify the border style */
            border-color: #111a23;
            margin-left: 10em;
            margin-top: 1em;
            margin-bottom: 1em;
          "
        />

        <p>
          <span class="blue-word">Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):</span> A
          man-in-the-middle attack is when an attacker “places” themselves in a
          line of communication between devices to
          <span class="blue-word">eavesdrop or alter messages</span>
          . In a way, this is a form of <span class="blue-word">spying</span>.
          If an attacker alters header information, such as the source IP
          address, this is more likely to be considered spoofing aided by
          interception. However, changing the payload instead is more closely
          related to interception.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="blue-word">Man-in-the-Browser (MITB):</span>
          Man-in-the-browser is a MITM attack where an attacker uses
          <span class="blue-word">malware on a web browser</span>
          to spy on a target's online affairs. This can be used to relay
          information back to attackers or allow attackers to
          <span class="blue-word">tamper</span> with the target's activities. A
          common example used for MITB is related to financial information and
          how MITB malware often picks up on this and gives it back to the
          attacker. A difference between this and MITM are that they work in
          <span class="blue-word">different layers</span>
          . Being in the browser, MITB is an
          <span class="blue-word">application layer attack</span>
          . MITM is a
          <span class="blue-word">network layer attack</span>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="blue-word">Proxy Servers:</span>
          Proxy servers are generally used as a
          <span class="blue-word">network layer defense mechanism</span>
          to check for alteration in packets as they travel through a network.
          However,
          <span class="blue-word">malicious proxy servers</span>
          can be created and placed in networks to intercept. Furthermore, proxy
          servers can be
          <span class="blue-word">hijacked</span>
          by attackers, turning them into malicious devices.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you hadn't already noticed,
          <span class="blue-word">interception</span> attacks share a lot of
          characteristics with <span class="blue-word">spyware,</span> and are
          quite synonymous with spying. Considering this, interception becomes a
          much more dangerous cyberattack.
