        <h2>Why is Cybersecurity More Critical NOW?</h2>
        <h3><span class="blue-word">Growing Cyber Attacks</span></h3>

        <p>
          In recent years, the rate of cyberattacks has
          <span class="blue-word">skyrocketed exponentially</span>. The same
          amount of attacks that happened in a year in 2014 now happen in a
          single day in 2024.…This rapid increase in attacks is predicted to
          only worsen in the upcoming years.
        </p>

          src="../../../Images/graph1.png"
          alt="graph showing the icnrease of significant cyber attacks"
        />

        <p>
          Surprisingly, the number of significant cyberattacks annually is now
          in the <span class="blue-word">billions</span>. With a shortage of
          Cybersecurity Professionals, it's really important to understand
          cybersecurity. The saying "it's always better to be prepared than
          sorry"always holds true…especially for CYBERSECURITY!
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Increased Costs</span></h3>
        <p>
          Hiring a <span class="blue-word">cybersecurity professional</span> may
          seem like a wonderful solution in certain scenarios…. ….but the truth
          is that government spending on cybersecurity professionals has
          consistently increased over the years. Hackers are becoming better
          hackers, making defending a constant challenge for cybersecurity
          professionals.
        </p>
