            >(Seven Ways to improve your Cybersecurity without spending a
            fortune…)</i
          >
        </p>

        <h3>1.<span class="green-word"> Attitude:</span></h3>
        <p>
          Understand that you are a <span class="blue-word">target.</span>
          People who believe that hackers want to breach their computers,
          smartphones, and other smart devices, act differently than people who
          do not grasp the true nature of the <span class="blue-word">threat.</span>
        </p>

        <h3>2.<span class="green-word"> Use Security Software</span></h3>
        <p>
          All devices that house
          <span class="blue-word">sensitive information</span>
          or that will be attached to networks with other devices do need
          security software.
        </p>

        <h3>3.<span class="green-word"> Encrypt Security Information</span></h3>
        <p>
          Store all sensitive data in an
          <span class="blue-word">encrypted</span> form. Encryption is built
          into many versions of Windows, and plenty of free encryption tools are
          available as well. It is amazing how much sensitive data that has been
          compromised could have remained <span class="blue-word">secure,</span> if only encryption was added.
        </p>

        <h3>4.<span class="green-word"> Back up often</span></h3>
        <p>
          Do not keep your <span class="blue-word">backups</span> attached to
          your computer or even to your computer network. If you do keep backups
          attached in such a fashion, you run a serious risk that if some
          ransomware or other malware somehow manages to infect your network, it
          can corrupt backups as well.
        </p>

        <h3>5.<span class="green-word"> Use Social Media Wisely</span></h3>
        <p>
          Oversharing information on social media <span class="blue-word">posts</span> has caused, and
          continues to cause, many problems, such as leaking sensitive
          information. Be sure your phone does not
          <span class="blue-word">autocorrect</span> anything to sensitive
          information when posting.
        </p>

        <h3>6.<span class="green-word"> Segregate Internet Access</span></h3>
        <p>
          Nearly all modern WIFI routers allow you to run two or more
          <span class="blue-word">networks</span>. If your router offers you
          such a feature, use it. If you work from home, for example, consider
          connecting your laptop to the Internet via a different <span class="blue-word">WIFI network</span>
          than the one your children use to browse the web and play video games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look for the <span class="blue-word">Guest feature</span> in your
          router’s configuration pages - that is where you will typically find
          the ability to set up the second network
        </p>

        <h3>
          7.<span class="green-word"></span>
            Use Public WIFI safely (Or better yet, don’t use it!)</span
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          While <span class="blue-word">public WIFI</span> is a great
          convenience that most people utilize regularly, it also creates
          serious cybersecurity risks. If your phone allows you to create an
          <span class="blue-word">Internet hotspot</span> to which other devices
          can connect, use that method instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="blue-word">Man-in-the-Middle attacks</span> frequently happen when using Public WIFI.
        </p>
