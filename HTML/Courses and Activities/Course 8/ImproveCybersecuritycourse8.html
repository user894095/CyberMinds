            >(Seven Ways to improve your Cybersecurity without spending a
            fortune…)</u
          >
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">1. Attitude:</span></h3>
        <p>
          Understand that you are a <span class="blue-word">target</span>. People who believe that hackers want
          to breach their computers, smartphones, and other smart devices, act
          differently than people who do not grasp the true nature of the
          threat.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">2. Use Security Software</span></h3>
        <p>
          All devices that house <span class="blue-word">sensitive information</span> or that will be attached
          to networks with other devices do need security software.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">3. Encrypt Security Information</span></h3>
        <p>
          Store all sensitive data in an <span class="blue-word">encrypted</span> form. Encryption is built
          into many versions of Windows, and plenty of free encryption tools are
          available as well. It is amazing how much sensitive data that has been
          compromised could have remained secure, if only encryption was added.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">4. Back up often</span></h3>
        <p>
          Do not keep your <span class="blue-word">backups</span> attached to your computer or even to your
          computer network. If you do keep backups attached in such a fashion,
          you run a serious risk that if some ransomware or other malware
          somehow manages to infect your network, it can corrupt backups as
          well.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">5. Use Social Media Wisely</span></h3>
        <p>
          Oversharing information on social media posts has caused, and
          continues to cause, many problems, such as leaking sensitive
          information. Be sure your phone does not <span class="blue-word">autocorrect</span> anything to
          sensitive information when posting.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">6. Segregate Internet Access</span></h3>
        <p>
          Nearly all modern WIFI routers allow you to run two or more <span class="blue-word">networks</span>.
          If your router offers you such a feature, use it. If you work from
          home, for example, consider connecting your laptop to the Internet via
          a different WIFI network than the one your children use to browse the
          web and play video games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look for the <span class="blue-word">Guest feature</span> in your router’s configuration pages - that
          is where you will typically find the ability to set up the second
          network
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">7. Use Public WIFI safely (Or better yet, don’t use it!)</span></h3>
        <p>
          While <span class="blue-word">public WIFI</span> is a great convenience that most people utilize
          regularly, it also creates serious cybersecurity risks. If your phone
          allows you to create an <span class="blue-word">Internet hotspot</span> to which other devices can
          connect, use that method instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man-in-the-Middle attacks frequently happen when using Public WIFI.
