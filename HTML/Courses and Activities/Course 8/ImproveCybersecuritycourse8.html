        <h2>Improve your Cybersecurity:</h2>
        <p>
          <u
            >(Seven Ways to improve your Cybersecurity without spending a
            fortune…)</u
          >
        </p>

        <h3>1. Attitude:</h3>
        <p>
          Understand that you are a target. People who believe that hackers want
          to breach their computers, smartphones, and other smart devices, act
          differently than people who do not grasp the true nature of the
          threat.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Use Security Software</h3>
        <p>
          All devices that house sensitive information or that will be attached
          to networks with other devices do need security software.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Encrypt Security Information</h3>
        <p>
          Store all sensitive data in an encrypted form. Encryption is built
          into many versions of Windows, and plenty of free encryption tools are
          available as well. It is amazing how much sensitive data that has been
          compromised could have remained secure, if only encryption was added.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Back up often</h3>
        <p>
          Do not keep your backups attached to your computer or even to your
          computer network. If you do keep backups attached in such a fashion,
          you run a serious risk that if some ransomware or other malware
          somehow manages to infect your network, it can corrupt backups as
          well.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Use Social Media Wisely</h3>
        <p>
          Oversharing information on social media posts has caused, and
          continues to cause, many problems, such as leaking sensitive
          information. Be sure your phone does not autocorrect anything to
          sensitive information when posting.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Segregate Internet Access</h3>
        <p>
          Nearly all modern WIFI routers allow you to run two or more networks.
          If your router offers you such a feature, use it. If you work from
          home, for example, consider connecting your laptop to the Internet via
          a different WIFI network than the one your children use to browse the
          web and play video games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look for the Guest feature in your router’s configuration pages - that
          is where you will typically find the ability to set up the second
          network
        </p>

        <h3>7. Use Public WIFI safely (Or better yet, don’t use it!)</h3>
        <p>
          While public WIFI is a great convenience that most people utilize
          regularly, it also creates serious cybersecurity risks. If your phone
          allows you to create an Internet hotspot to which other devices can
          connect, use that method instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man-in-the-Middle attacks frequently happen when using Public WIFI.
