        <p>
          After you identify what you must protect, you must develop and
          implement appropriate safeguards for those items to keep them as
          secure as possible.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word">What is "Protection" in Cybersecurity?</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Protecting includes providing barriers to anyone seeking to access
          your digital and physical assets without proper
          <span class="blue-word">authorization</span> to do so, establishing
          processes and procedures to protect your sensitive
          <span class="blue-word">data</span>.
        </p>

        <h4>
          <span class="blue-word"
            >Basic elements of protecting for most individuals include:</span
          >
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="green-word">Your</span> Perimeter Defense</li>
          <li><span class="green-word">Your</span> Firewall/router</li>
          <li><span class="green-word">Your</span> Security Software</li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Your</span> physical computer and endpoints
          </li>
          <li><span class="green-word">Your</span> Backups</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word">Perimeter Defense:</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Defending your perimeter is essentially the digital equivalent of
          building a <span class="blue-word">moat</span> around a castle- and
          attempting to stop anyone from entering.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can build that digital <span class="blue-word">moat</span> by
          never connecting a computer directly to your Internet
          <span class="blue-word">modem</span>. Instead, connect a
          <span class="blue-word">firewall/router</span> to the modem and
          connect computers to the
          <span class="blue-word">firewall/router</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Side Note: A <span class="blue-word">modem</span> is a network device
          that connects your devices to the internet. It does this by converting
          digital data signals into analog signals that can be transmitted over
          phone lines.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word">Firewall / Router:</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Modern routers used in home environments include
          <span class="blue-word">firewalling</span> capabilities that block
          most forms of inbound traffic. A
          <span class="blue-word">firewall</span>
          blocks outsiders from trying to contact a computer inside your home,
          but it will not block a web server from responding if a computer
          inside your home requests a web page from the server.
        </p>

        <p>
          One important technology is Network Address Translation (<span
            class="blue-word"
            >NAT</span
          >), which allows computers on your home network to use Internet
          Protocol (IP) addresses that are invalid for use on the internet, but
          can be used on private networks. To the internet, all devices on
          networks using <span class="blue-word">NAT</span> appear to use one
          address, which is the address of the firewall that is situated between
          them (the devices) and the Internet. This gives increased protection,
          as <span class="blue-word">attacks</span> won’t get the specific IP
          address for your individual device.
        </p>

        <h4>
          <span class="blue-word"
            >The following tips will help your router/firewall protect
            you:</span
          >
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Replace your router when it is no longer supported (replace when the
            vendor is no longer providing
            <span class="green-word">support</span> (including updates) for the
            router)
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the default administrative
            <span class="green-word">password</span> on your firewall/router to
            a strong <span class="green-word">password</span> that only you know
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t use the default name provided by your router for your WIFI
            network <span class="green-word">name</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Configure your WIFI network to use encryption of at least the WPA2
            standard, and use WPA3 if possible
          </li>
          <li>
            Establish a <span class="green-word">password</span> that any device
            is required to know to join your WIFI network
          </li>
        </ul>
