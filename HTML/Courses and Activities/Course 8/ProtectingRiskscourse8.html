        <h2>Protecting Against Risks</h2>
        <p>
          After you identify what you must protect, you must develop and
          implement appropriate safeguards for those items to keep them as
          secure as possible.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word">What is "Protection" in Cybersecurity?</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Protecting includes providing barriers to anyone seeking to access
          your digital and physical assets without proper authorization to do
          so, establishing processes and procedures to protect your sensitive
          data.
        </p>

        <h4>
          <span class="blue-word"
            >Basic elements of protecting for most individuals include:</span
          >
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Perimeter Defense</li>
          <li>Firewall/router</li>
          <li>Security Software</li>
          <li>Your physical computer and endpoints</li>
          <li>Backups</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word">Perimeter Defense:</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Defending your perimeter is essentially the digital equivalent of
          building a moat around a castle- and attempting to stop anyone from
          entering.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can build that digital moat by never connecting a computer
          directly to your Internet modem. Instead connect a firewall/router to
          the modem and connect computers to the firewall/router.
        </p>
        <p>
          Side Note: A modem is a network device that connects your devices to
          the internet. It does this by converting digital data signals into
          analog signals that can be transmitted over phone lines.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word">Firewall / Router:</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Modern routers used in home environments include firewalling
          capabilities that block most forms of inbound traffic. A firewall
          blocks outsiders from trying to contact a computer inside your home,
          but it will not block a web server from responding if a computer
          inside your home requests a web page from the server.
        </p>

        <p>
          One important technology is Network Address Translation (NAT), which
          allows computers on your home network to use Internet Protocol (IP)
          addresses that are invalid for use on the internet, but can be used on
          private networks. To the internet, all devices on networks using NAT
          appear to use one address, which is the address of the firewall that
          is situated between them (the devices) and the Internet. This gives
          increased protection, as attaches won’t get the specific IP address
          for your individual device.
        </p>

        <h4>
          <span class="blue-word"
            >The following tips will help your router/firewall protect
            you:</span
          >
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Replace your router when it is no longer supported (replace when the
            vendor is no longer providing support (including updates) for the
            router)
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the default administrative password on your firewall/router
            to a strong password that only you know
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t use the default name provided by your router for your WIFI
            network name
          </li>
          <li>
            Configure your WIFI network to use encryption of at least the WPA2
            standard, and use WPA3 if possible
          </li>
          <li>
            Establish a password that any device is required to know to join
            your WIFI network
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word">Security Software:</span>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use all security software on all your computers and mobile devices.
            The software should contain at least antivirus and personal device
            firewall capabilities
          </li>
          <li>Use anti spam software on any device on which you read email</li>
          <li>Enable remote wipe on any and every mobile device</li>
          <li>
            Require a strong password to log in any computer and mobile device
          </li>
          <li>
            Enable auto-updates whenever possible and keep your devices updated
