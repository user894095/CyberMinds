        <h2>Protecting Against Risks</h2>
        <p>After you identify what you must protect, you must develop and implement appropriate safeguards for those items to keep them as secure as possible. </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">What is Protecting?</span></h3>
        <p>Protecting includes providing barriers to anyone seeking to access your digital and physical assets without proper authorization to do so, establishing processes and procedures to protect your sensitive data.
        </p>

        <h4><span class="blue-word">Basic elements of protecting for most individuals include:</span> </h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Perimeter Defense</li>
          <li>Firewall/router</li>
          <li>Security Software</li>
          <li>Your physical computer and endpoints</li>
          <li>Backups</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><i><span class="blue-word">Perimeter Defense:</span></i></h3>

        <p>Defending your perimeter is essentially the digital equivalent of building a moat around a castle- and attempting to stop anyone from entering. </p>
        <p>You can build that digital moat by never connecting a computer directly to your Internet modem. Instead connect a firewall/router to the modem and connect computers to the firewall/router. </p>
        <p>Side Note: A modem is a network device that connects your devices to the internet. It does this by converting digital data signals into analog signals that can be transmitted over phone lines. </p>

        <h3><i><span class="blue-word">Firewall / Router:</span></i></h3>

        <p>Modern routers used in home environments include firewalling capabilities that block most forms of inbound traffic. A firewall blocks outsiders from trying to contact a computer inside your home, but it will not block a web server from responding if a computer inside your home requests a web page from the server. </p>

        <p>One important technology is Network Address Translation (NAT), which allows computers on your home network to use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that are invalid for use on the internet, but can be used on private networks. To the internet, all devices on networks using NAT appear to use one address, which is the address of the firewall that is situated between them (the devices) and the Internet. This gives increased protection, as attaches won’t get the specific IP address for your individual device. 
        </p>

        <h4><span class="blue-word">The following tips will help your router/firewall protect you:</span></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Replace your router when it is no longer supported (replace when the vendor is no longer providing support (including updates) for the router)</li>
          <li>Change the default administrative password on your firewall/router to a strong password that only you know</li>
          <li>Don’t use the default name provided by your router for your WIFI network name</li>
          <li>Configure your WIFI network to use encryption of at least the WPA2 standard, and use WPA3 if possible</li>
          <li>Establish a password that any device is required to know to join your WIFI network</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><i><span class="blue-word">Security Software:</span></i></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use all security software on all your computers and mobile devices. The software should contain at least antivirus and personal device firewall capabilities</li>
          <li>Use anti spam software on any device on which you read email</li>
          <li>Enable remote wipe on any and every mobile device</li>
          <li>Require a strong password to log in any  computer and mobile device</li>
          <li>Enable auto-updates whenever possible and keep your devices updated</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3><i><span class="blue-word">Your Physical Computer(s) and any other Endpoints:</span></i></h3>
        <ul class="list-without-bullet-points">
          <li>
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Control physical access to your computer and keep it in a safe location</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> If possible, do not share your computer with family members</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Do not rely on deleting data before throwing out, recycling, donating, or selling an old device. (Use a multiwipe erasure system for all hard drives and solid state drives. Ideally, remove the storage media from all computer before getting rid of the device. )</p>
