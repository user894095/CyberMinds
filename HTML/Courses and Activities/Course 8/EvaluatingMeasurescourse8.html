    <div><p class="page-title">Course 8- Evaluating Your Measures</p></div>

    <section>
      <div class="right-side_rectangle">
        <p>After you know what you need to <span class="blue-word">protect</span> and how to protect such items, you can determine the difference between what you need and what you currently have <span class="blue-word">deployed</span> in place.</p>

        <p>When it comes to software/hardware and <span class="blue-word">Cybersecurity,</span> think about the following questions for each device:</p>
        <ul class="list-without-bullet-points">
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Are all the software packages(including the operating system itself) on your computer <span class="green-word">legally obtained?</span></p></li>
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Were the software packages obtained from reliable sources that always provide <span class="green-word">legitimate versions?</span></p></li>
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Are all the software packages <span class="green-word">supported</span> by their respective vendors?</p></li>
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Are all the software packages set to <span class="green-word">automatically update?</span></p></li>
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Is <span class="green-word">security software</span> on the device?</p></li>
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Is the security software configured to <span class="green-word">auto-update?</span></p></li>
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Does the security software include <span class="green-word">anti-malware</span> technology - and is that capability fully enabled?</p></li>
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Are <span class="green-word">virus scans</span> configured to run after every update is applied?</p></li>
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Does the software include <span class="green-word">firewall technology</span>?</p></li>
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Does the software include <span class="green-word">anti-spam</span> technology?</p></li>
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Was the hardware obtained from a <span class="green-word">trusted party</span>- (If you bought an IP - based camera directly from China via some online retailer that you never heard of prior to making the purchase, for example, the answer to this question may not be yes)</p></li>
          <li><p><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Is <span class="green-word">encryption</span> enabled for at least all sensitive data stored on the device?</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span class="blue-word"> <u>Think</u> before you share, <u>think</u> before you post:</span></h3>
        <ul class="list-without-bullet-points">

          <li style="color:rgb(42, 98, 203)" class="horizontal-list"> <h3 style="font-size: 1.3em">Think!</h2></li>
          <li style="color:rgb(73, 124, 218)" class="horizontal-list"> <h4>Think! </h4> </li>
          <li style="color:rgb(110, 160, 230)" class="horizontal-list">  <h5>Think!</h5> </li>
          
        </ul>

        <p>I cannot emphasize the <span class="blue-word">IMPORTANCE </span>of sharing your information carefully.</p>
        <p>People often willingly overshare information when asked for it.</p>

        <p><i>Yes, you and me included.</i></p>
        <p>Even if you don’t believe that a party asking about you for personal data would ever abuse the information that is collected about you, as the number of parties that have private information about you increases, and as the quantity and quality of that data grows, the odds rise that you will suffer a <span class="blue-word">privacy violation</span> due to a data breach occurring somewhere. </p>

        <p>If you want to <span class="blue-word">improve</span> your privacy, the first thing to do is to consider what information you may be disclosing about yourself and your loved ones before you disclose it. If you do not need to provide private information, don’t. The less private information that is, “out there”, and the fewer places it resides, the lower the risk to you of a <span class="blue-word">privacy compromise</span>. </p>

        <p>Consider the implications of any <span class="blue-word">social media</span> post before making it - there could be adverse consequences of many sorts. </p>

        <p>For example, criminals can leverage shared information about a person’s family relationships, place of employment, and interests as part of <span class="blue-word">identity theft</span> and to social engineer their way into your accounts. </p>

        <p>Keep in mind, <span class="blue-word">oversharing</span> is not limited to social- networks. Oversharing information via chat, email, group chats, and so on is a serious modern day problem as well. </p>
