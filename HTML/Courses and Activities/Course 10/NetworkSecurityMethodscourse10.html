      <h2>Network Security Methods</h2>
      <h3>DMZ:</h3>
      <p>In <span class="blue-word">networking</span>, a <span class="blue-word">demilitarized zone (DMZ)</span> refers
        to the virual space
        surrounding a <span class="blue-word">local area network (LAN)</span>. It serves as a space where
        security measures can be implemented before data enters and exits the network or certain devices.
      </p>
      <h3>Firewall:</h3>
      <p>
        A firewall is a <span class="blue-word">network level device</span> that is able to filter data in a network for
        security. This is also an example of a device that would be placed in the<span class="blue-word">DMZ</span>.
        This means that firewalls can allow and block packets from different IP addresses, ports, etc. It can blacklist
        or whitelist.
        Additionally, there are two types of firewalls: <span class="blue-word">stateless</span> and <span
          class="blue-word">stateful</span>. A stateless firewall has the ability to block and allow data as necessary.
        However, stateful firewalls are more advanced and can make detailed analyses of packets. This allows them to
        keep track of additional information beyond safety that they can filter.
      </p>
      <h3>Proxy Server:</h3>
      <p>
        A proxy server is a <span class="blue-word">server that is meant to analyze packets during transit</span>. A
        proxy server is strategically placed in a network and acts as a checkpoint where packets can be analyzed.
        If the data is not found to be malicious or poorly formatted in any way, the proxy server will allow the packets
        to continue to their destination.
      </p>
      <h3>Other:</h3>
      <p>
        Other software and methods that are used outside of the network layer can also be implemented here as well.
        Examples of these include <span class="blue-word">intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS and
          IPS)</span> as well as <span class="blue-word">acess control</span>.
        Controlling access to different parts of a network can also add increased security and is important to <span
          class="blue-word">any</span> part of a system.
        It also serves to implement separation of concerns or least privilege. If you want to know more about any of
        these concepts, go to <span class="blue-word">Course 4</span>.
