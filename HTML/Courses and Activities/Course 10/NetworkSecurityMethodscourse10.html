        <h2>Network Security Methods</h2>
        <h3 class="blue-word">DMZ:</h3>
        <p>
          In <span class="blue-word">networking</span>, a
          <span class="blue-word">demilitarized zone (DMZ)</span> refers to the
          virual space surrounding a
          <span class="blue-word">local area network (LAN)</span>. It serves as
          a space where security measures can be implemented before data enters
          and exits the network or certain devices.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blue-word">Firewall:</h3>
        <p>
          A firewall is a
          <span class="blue-word">network level device</span> that is able to
          filter data in a network for security. This is also an example of a
          device that would be placed in the<span class="blue-word">DMZ</span>.
          This means that firewalls can allow and block packets from different
          IP addresses, ports, etc. It can blacklist or whitelist. Additionally,
          there are two types of firewalls:
          <span class="blue-word">stateless</span> and
          <span class="blue-word">stateful</span>. A stateless firewall has the
          ability to block and allow data as necessary. However, stateful
          firewalls are more advanced and can make detailed analyses of packets.
          This allows them to keep track of additional information beyond safety
          that they can filter.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blue-word">Proxy Server:</h3>
        <p>
          A proxy server is a
          <span class="blue-word"
            >server that is meant to analyze packets during transit</span
          >. A proxy server is strategically placed in a network and acts as a
          checkpoint where packets can be analyzed. If the data is not found to
          be malicious or poorly formatted in any way, the proxy server will
          allow the packets to continue to their destination.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blue-word">Other:</h3>
        <p>
          Other software and methods that are used outside of the network layer
          can also be implemented here as well. Examples of these include
          <span class="blue-word"
            >intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS and IPS)</span
          >
          as well as <span class="blue-word">acess control</span>. Controlling
          access to different parts of a network can also add increased security
          and is important to <span class="blue-word">any</span> part of a
          system. It also serves to implement separation of concerns or least
          privilege. If you want to know more about any of these concepts, go to
          <span class="blue-word">Course 4</span>.
