        <h3><span class="blue-word">Devices:</span></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Endpoint:</span> a device on a network that is not meant to transfer data
            between other devices. This includes users’ computers
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Switch:</span> layer 2 device (we will talk about this with the OSI Model
            article) that connects local devices together
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Router:</span> layer 3 device that connects to other switches, routers,
            servers, etc. (other intermediary devices)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Server:</span> a computing device designated to handle data and provide
            services to other devices on a network, known as clients
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Peripherals (Additional):</span> additional devices that are connected to a
            network that the network can still function without. An example of
            this is a computer mouse
          </li>

        <h3 class="blue-word">Wired vs. Wireless:</h3>

        <p>
          Networks are either wired or wireless, each have different benefits
          and drawbacks in security. <span class="blue-word">Wired</span> connections function because of the
          electrical signals exchanged between them. This type of connection is
          highly reliable and fast. However, it can be expensive to buy and
          manage so many cables. People using <span class="blue-word">wireless</span> connections don’t have to
          deal with confusing cables and don’t have to spend as much. Wireless
          connections are more prone to signal interference, making them a
          little less secure and slower.
        </p>

        <h3> <span class="blue-word">
          States of Data:
        </span></h3>

        <p>
          Throughout the courses on this website, you have probably seen
          references to “data in storage” or “in transit.” Knowing the difference
          between these states is important because there are <span class="blue-word">different</span> security
          concepts that belong in different states. Here are the states of data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Data in Storage:</span> also known as data at rest, any data that is not
            traveling or in use is stored somewhere
          <span></li></span>
          <li>
            <span class="green-word">Data in Transit:</span> data traveling between different destinations (ex.
            An email)
          </li>
          <li><span class="green-word">Data in Use:</span> data that is being processed or presented</li>
        </ul>
