        <h2>Fault Tolerance:</h2>
        <p>
          Fault tolerance refers to how
          <span class="blue-word">resilient</span> a network is to failure. For
          example, a network that can still fully
          <span class="blue-word">operate</span> if a connection fails has high
          fault tolerance, and vice versa. Higher fault tolerance is better for
          security since it is less likely that systems can go down when things
          go wrong! <span class="blue-word">However,</span> high fault tolerance
          may come at higher costs. This is
          <span class="blue-word">reflected</span> in a variety of network
          topologies. Network topologies are the different structures of a
          network. Letâ€™s look at some:
        </p>

        <h2>Network Topologies:</h2>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Line:</span></h3>

        <p>
          The line topology is, like its name suggests,
          <span class="blue-word">a line</span>. Since it uses ta
          <span class="blue-word">minimal</span> amount of wires to connect
          everything, it's more cost efficient. However, it is less secure
          because data must pass through all
          <span class="blue-word">intermediate nodes</span> before reaching its
          destination. It also has low fault tolerance.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Bus:</span></h3>

        <p>
          The bus topology is a little more secure, since packets do
          <span class="blue-word">NOT</span> have intermediate nodes they must
          pass through, but it is still not that fault tolerant. If the main
          line were to fail, it would cause a lot of the
          <span class="blue-word">network</span> to stop functioning.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Ring:</span></h3>

        <p>
          The ring topology is another one in which packets are
          <span class="blue-word">forced</span> to go through many nodes to
          reach the destination. However, if one connection were to fail,
          packets would still be able to
          <span class="blue-word">travel</span> the other way around to their
          destination, so it is a little more
          <span class="blue-word">resilient!</span>
        </p>

        <h3><span class="blue-word">Fully Connected:</span></h3>

        <p>
          The fully connected topology is where
          <span class="blue-word">every</span> node is directly connected to the
          others. This is one of the most fault tolerant, since packets have a
          multitude of ways to get to the destination. However, the
          <span class="blue-word">cost</span> of having all these wires to
          connect nodes really adds up, which is what prevents individuals and
          companies from <span class="blue-word">defaulting</span> to this
          method.
        </p>
