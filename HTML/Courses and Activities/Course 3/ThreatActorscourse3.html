          So far in this course (and later on) the word
          <span class="blue-word">“attacker”</span> has been used to talk about
          people who attempt to
          <span class="blue-word">compromise or gain access</span> to a system.
          A more formal and
          <span class="blue-word">cybersecurity-specific</span> term for this is
          a <span class="blue-word">“threat actor.”</span> A threat actor is an
          individual or group who carries out cyberattacks. Cybersecurity
          professionals must be familiar with the
          <span class="blue-word">motives</span> and
          <span class="blue-word">level of risk</span> that different threat
          actors possess in order to know how to deal with them.

        <h1>Types of Threat Actors:</h1>

        <h2><span class="blue-word">Script Kiddies:</span></h2>

        <p>
          Script Kiddies are
          <span class="blue-word">inexperienced hackers</span>. Sometimes, they
          are inexperienced to the point where they are not really sure what
          they are doing. However, they could still cause more
          <span class="blue-word">accidental damage</span> to a system than an
          experienced hacker would intentionally inflict. Without control over
          what they are doing, they can have devastating impacts. If they manage
          to be a little less destructive, script kiddies are just
          <span class="blue-word">nuisances to businesses</span> and
          individuals.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="blue-word">Insider Threats:</span></h2>

        <p>
          An insider threat is a
          <span class="blue-word"
            >threat from someone who has already had access to a system</span
          >. An example of this could be a
          <span class="blue-word">company employee</span> attempting to share
          confidential information to competitors. Since insiders know the
          <span class="blue-word">information, structure, or credentials</span>
          to a system, they could share them at any moment to anyone, making
          them a cybersecurity risk. Insiders don’t even have to be technology
          professionals, they just need to reveal enough to other threat actors
          who will take advantage of their information.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <span class="blue-word">Criminals/Crime Groups:</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
          Cybercriminals primarily seek
          <span class="blue-word">financial gain</span>, either through
          <span class="blue-word">hacking</span> to steal or
          <span class="blue-word">ransom</span>. Within the category of
          cybercriminals, organized crime groups are
          <span class="blue-word">more sophisticated</span> in their techniques
          and are <span class="blue-word">more dangerous</span> than ordinary
          cybercriminals.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="blue-word">State-Sponsored:</span></h2>

        <p>
          State-sponsored threat actors
          <span class="blue-word">work for governments</span>. States hire
          <span class="blue-word"
            >incredibly experienced and sophisticated</span
          >
          hackers and security professionals. This makes a government's
          cybersecurity
          <span class="blue-word">offense and defense very strong</span>. In
          regards to attacking, state-sponsored hackers are the most dangerous
          due to their skills and tools at their disposal.
        </p>
