        <p>
          So far in this course (and later on) the word “attacker” has been used
          to talk about people who attempt to compromise or gain access to a
          system. A more formal term, and a more cybersecurity-specific term for
          this, is a “threat actor.” A threat actor is an individual or group
          who carries out cyberattacks. Cybersecurity professionals must be
          familiar with the motives and level of risk that different threat
          actors possess in order to know how to deal with them.

        <h1>Types of Threat Actors:</h1>

        <h2>Script Kiddies:</h2>

        <p>
          Script Kiddies are inexperienced hackers. Sometimes, they are
          inexperienced to the point where they are not really sure what they
          are doing. However, they could still cause more accidental damage to a
          system than an experienced hacker would want to intentionally damage.
          Without control over what they are doing, they can have devastating
          impacts, even though this is unlikely to happen. If they are a little
          less destructive, script kiddies are just nuisances to businesses and
          individuals.
        </p>

        <h2>Insider Threats:</h2>

        <p>
          An insider threat is a threat from someone who has already had access
          to a system. An example of this could be a company employee attempting
          to share confidential information to competitors. Since insiders know
          the information, structure, or credentials to a system, they could
          share them at any moment to anyone, making them a cybersecurity risk.
          Insiders don’t even have to be technology professionals, they just
          need to reveal enough to other threat actors who will take advantage
          of their information.
        </p>

        <h2>Criminals/Crime Groups:</h2>

        <p>
          Cybercriminals primarily seek financial gain, either through hacking
          to steal or via ransom. Within the category of cybercriminals,
          organized crime groups are more sophisticated in their techniques and
          are more dangerous than ordinary cybercriminals.
        </p>

        <h2>State-Sponsored:</h2>

        <p>
          State-sponsored threat actors work for governments. States hire
          incredibly experienced and sophisticated hackers and security
          professionals. This makes a government's cybersecurity offense and
          defense very strong. In regards to attacking, state-sponsored hackers
          are the most dangerous due to their skills and tools at their
          disposal.
