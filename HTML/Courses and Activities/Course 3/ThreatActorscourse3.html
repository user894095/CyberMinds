          So far in this course (and later on) the word <span class="blue-word">“attacker”</span> has been used
          to talk about people who attempt to <span class="blue-word">compromise or gain access</span> to a
          system. A more formal term, and a more <span class="blue-word">cybersecurity-specific</span> term for
          this, is a <span class="blue-word">“threat actor.”</span> A threat actor is an individual or group
          who carries out cyberattacks. Cybersecurity professionals must be
          familiar with the <span class="blue-word">motives</span> and <span class="blue-word">level of risk</span> that different threat
          actors possess in order to know how to deal with them.

        <h1>Types of Threat Actors:</h1>

        <h2><span class="blue-word">Script Kiddies:</span></h2>

        <p>
          Script Kiddies are <span class="blue-word">inexperienced hackers</span>. Sometimes, they are
          inexperienced to the point where they are not really sure what they
          are doing. However, they could still cause more <span class="blue-word">accidental damage</span> to a
          system than an experienced hacker would want to intentionally damage.
          Without control over what they are doing, they can have devastating
          impacts, even though this is unlikely to happen. If they are a little
          less destructive, script kiddies are just <span class="blue-word">nuisances to businesses</span> and
          individuals.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="blue-word">Insider Threats:</span></h2>

        <p>
          An insider threat is a <span class="blue-word">threat from someone who has already had access
          to a system</span>. An example of this could be a <span class="blue-word">company employee</span> attempting
          to share confidential information to competitors. Since insiders know
          the <span class="blue-word">information, structure, or credentials</span> to a system, they could
          share them at any moment to anyone, making them a cybersecurity risk.
          Insiders don’t even have to be technology professionals, they just
          need to reveal enough to other threat actors who will take advantage
          of their information.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <span class="blue-word">Criminals/Crime Groups:</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
          Cybercriminals primarily seek <span class="blue-word">financial gain</span>, either through <span class="blue-word">hacking</span>
          to steal or via <span class="blue-word">ransom</span>. Within the category of cybercriminals,
          organized crime groups are <span class="blue-word">more sophisticated</span> in their techniques and
          are <span class="blue-word">more dangerous</span> than ordinary cybercriminals.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="blue-word">State-Sponsored:</span></h2>

        <p>
          State-sponsored threat actors <span class="blue-word">work for governments</span>. States hire
          <span class="blue-word">incredibly experienced and sophisticated</span> hackers and security
          professionals. This makes a government's cybersecurity <span class="blue-word">offense and
          defense very strong</span>. In regards to attacking, state-sponsored hackers
          are the most dangerous due to their skills and tools at their
          disposal.
        </p>
